# DokamiPOS
Point of sales application created in C# and MySQL

Dokami POS allows users to create products with custom brands, categories, prices, and barcodes to be used in a sales environment. The system uses C# and MySQL libraries 
to store and modify items held within a database. Included in the code is the ability to utilize an USB barcode scanner to quickly add items to a customer's shopping cart; alternatively, barcodes can be entered manually to achieve the same task.

Posted below are screenshots of the applications logic and UI.
